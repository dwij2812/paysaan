## About Paysaan
Agriculture is the most important sector of Indian Economy. Indian agriculture sector accounts for 18 per cent of India's gross domestic product (GDP) and provides employment to 50% of the countries workforce. Yet everyday we can see that the farmers are in various kinds of troubles and are facing a lot of issues economically as well as they are not able to tap the schemes or tech facilities available which can help solve a lot of issues.

In order to address these issues we have come with Paysaan, a decentralized payment cum micro-insurance transaction system on a decentralized blockchain public ledger along with an responsive UI which can help farmers make secure payments which are recorded in public ledgers and can act as a proof in case any fraud or mismanagement related to payments that happen against him. Similarly we have introduced a facility to purchase micro-insurance and add the details of the same to the ledger so that they get the freedom to decide the amount, type, validity of the coverage at a very flexible price and also help them get claims instantly in case of calamities as there is almost no documentation needed for the same.

Further the whole platform is decoupled and various developers can use the dev-friendly APIs in order to integrate into their apps and make secure payments using the paysaan network. You need not worry about security, as we have Multi Factor Authentication from the user side to process the transactions and various Hashing and Encryption algorithms is place at multiple levels to keep you safe and enjoy transacting and progressing.
